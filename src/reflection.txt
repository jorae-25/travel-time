I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this program





1. One persist bug that I encountered was a nullPointerException that
was the result of me trying to access elements of the roads ArrayList
before they were created. I overcame this by using a boolean hasRoads
function in my addRoad function. I learned that looking through the
text file is helpful in debugging.

2. I only received help from professor Kirlin, prior knowledge, google searches and this site
https://progressivecoder.com/graph-implementation-in-java-using-hashmap/

3. The most serious problem I encountered was trying to get my output to display correctly.
This required me to do some review of OOP concepts to finally get it correct.

4. There were no challenges.

5. I think this was a medium level project that I enjoyed. It got me reacquainted with Java and
helped me to brush up on my graph implementation skills.
